*****CHANGES I MADE*****

********************
student_details.php
********************

- I changed the name of the global variable 'studentID' to 'static_studentID' becuase it seemed to be changing
  the value somewhere else in the code and posting the wrong ID to 'read_book_submit'

- I changed this query:       

//query to find all current student info
 $query = "SELECT teachers.first_name AS tfn, teachers.last_name AS tln, students.id AS sid, students.first_name AS sfn,
                     students.last_name AS sln, students.starting_reading_lvl AS srl, students.current_reading_lvl AS crl,
                     students.goal_reading_lvl AS grl, books.name AS bkn, books.reading_lvl AS bkrl, books_read.b_id AS bid
              FROM teachers, students, books, books_read
              WHERE students.first_name = '$studentFirstName' AND
                    students.last_name = '$studentLastName' AND
                    teachers.id = students.teacher_id AND
                    books_read.s_id = students.id AND
                    books.id = books_read.b_id";

  to this:
    //query to find all current student info
    $query = "SELECT teachers.first_name AS tfn, teachers.last_name AS tln, students.id AS sid, students.first_name AS sfn,
                     students.last_name AS sln, students.starting_reading_lvl AS srl, students.current_reading_lvl AS crl,
                     students.goal_reading_lvl AS grl, books.name AS bkn, books.reading_lvl AS bkrl, books_read.b_id AS bid
              FROM teachers, students, books, books_read
              WHERE students.first_name = '$studentFirstName' AND
                    students.last_name = '$studentLastName' AND
                    teachers.id = students.teacher_id";
